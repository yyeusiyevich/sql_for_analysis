## Description :key:
This project involved the design and creation of two separate databases using SQL. In the first part, a recruitment database was created with additional data types, triggers, and functions specified. Data was then inserted into the database using data validation techniques, and an ERD was designed to provide a visual representation of the database's structure. In the second part, a simple database for a healthcare system was designed and created using SQL, and data was populated into the database.


## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
- Plan and design a database for the business in question that includes additional data types, triggers, and functions.
- Implement the designed database by creating the necessary tables and relations.
- Insert data into the recruitment database, while ensuring data consistency and integrity using validation techniques.
- Create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the 3NF of the database to represent the structure visually.
- Populate the database with relevant data.

## Used Tools :mortar_board:
