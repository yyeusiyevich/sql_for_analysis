![YM-logo](home.jpg)

## Description :key:
In the Home Haven project, the goal was to create a database for a household store. Starting with the business description and data storage problems, the project progressed to data modeling from the conceptual to the logical model, followed by the creation of appropriate schemas. Next, a physical model was created in PostgreSQL, taking into account data validation and consistency requirements. Finally, a manager role was created with appropriate privileges to ensure secure access to the database.
