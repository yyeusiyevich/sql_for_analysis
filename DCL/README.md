![YM-logo](security.jpg)

## Description :key:
This project focuses on DCL statements such as grant and revoke, specifically in the context of the Sakila database. The main objectives were to identify the existing security measures in place and to implement a role-based authentication model. Additionally, row-level security was configured to ensure that customers can only access their own data. The project also explored recommended authentication protocols and differences between user identification and authentication, as well as proxy authentication in PostgreSQL.
