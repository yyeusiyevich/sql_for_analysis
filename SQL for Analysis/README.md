## Description :key:
In this project, I delved into the Sales History Database, seeking to unlock its hidden treasures. I set out to create Star and Snowflake schemas, paving the way for further analysis.

Armed with this data, I turned to Excel to create captivating visualizations, presenting my findings in a comprehensive report.
