![YM-logo](window.jpg)

## Description :key:
Window functions are a powerful feature in SQL that allow for efficient data analysis by partitioning a set of data and performing calculations within that subset. They are used to perform complex analytical tasks such as ranking, running totals, and moving averages. In this project, window functions were applied to the Sales History database to analyze customer behavior and identify trends in purchasing patterns.


## Tasks :ballot_box_with_check:
- Generate a report about the most significant customers (which have maximum sales);
- Retrieve data for report with sales totals for all products in specified category and region. 
- Analyze annual sales by channels and regions.
- Generate a weekly sales sales report.
- Create some custom qureies that will show the difference between different modes of window frames in PostgreSQL.
