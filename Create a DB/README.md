# Create a Database (recruitment agency, food delivery)
![YM-logo](recruitment.jpg)
Welcome to my project, where I've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a recruitment agency using the Lucidchart tool. The ERD includes an Infological model with entities, relationships, specified columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and data types.

To begin, I wrote a business description that outlines how the recruitment agency works and identified the challenges they face in data storage. I then revealed the advantages of creating a database to help manage the agency's data more efficiently and effectively.

Next, I approached the DB modeling step-by-step, identifying and describing all of the DB objects. This includes the creation of tables for entities such as job seekers, job postings, resumes, interviews, and placements, among others. Each table includes the necessary columns, primary keys, and foreign keys, which establish the relationships between the entities.

By creating this database, the recruitment agency will be able to manage their data more efficiently, enabling them to easily track job postings, resumes, job seekers, and interviews. The ERD provides a visual representation of the database's structure, making it easy for stakeholders to understand and maintain.

Overall, this project demonstrates the value of ERD and database design in solving complex business problems and improving data management.
