| [Create a DB](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/Create%20a%20DB) | In this project I've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a recruitment agency using the Lucidchart tool. The ERD includes an Infological model with entities, relationships, specified columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and data types. The business description that outlines how the recruitment agency works and identified the challenges they face in data storage. It also contains the DB modeling step-by-step and identifying and describing all of the DB objects.  | ERD, Lucidchart, Infological model, Recruitment Agency, Database Design, Data Management, Job Seekers, Job Postings, Resumes, Interviews. |
| [DQL](---) | The Sakila database is a sample database that is widely used in the industry for learning and testing purposes. It provides a rich and complex data model that captures information related to a fictional DVD rental company, including details on customers, films, rentals, and payments. The SQL queries were carefully designed to extract meaningful and relevant information, and the results were analyzed and interpreted to draw conclusions and develop recommendations. | SQL, Database Analysis, Sakila Database, ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, CTE, Films, Filming, Actors, Movie Genres. |
