Repository contains portfolio of data analysis projects with SQL code, including DML, DDL, DQL, DCL and TCL statements, functions, OLTP and OLAP (star and snowflacke). Here, you'll find examples of entity-relationship diagrams and databases created using PostgreSQL language. From building databases to writing complex queries, you'll find a wealth of valuable information and examples to help you improve your skills. So, feel free to explore and experiment with the code in this repository, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.

**Programming languages:** SQL (PostgreSQL, PLpgsql).

| ---------- | ----------  | ---------- | 
| [Create a DB](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/Create%20a%20DB) | In this project I've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a recruitment agency using the Lucidchart tool. The ERD includes an Infological model with entities, relationships, specified columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and data types. The business description that outlines how the recruitment agency works and identified the challenges they face in data storage. It also contains the DB modeling step-by-step and identifying and describing all of the DB objects.  | ERD, Lucidchart, Infological model, Recruitment Agency, Database Design, Data Management, Job Seekers, Job Postings, Resumes, Interviews. |
| [DQL](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/DQL) | The Sakila database is a sample database that is widely used in the industry for learning and testing purposes. It provides a rich and complex data model that captures information related to a fictional DVD rental company, including details on customers, films, rentals, and payments. The SQL queries were carefully designed to extract meaningful and relevant information, and the results were analyzed and interpreted to draw conclusions and develop recommendations. | SQL, Database Analysis, Sakila Database, ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, CTE, Films, Filming, Actors, Movie Genres. |
| [DML](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/blob/main/DML/README.md) | This part involved two main objectives: firstly, to explore the differences between delete and truncate statements, as well as the vacuum command, and secondly, to work with the Sakila database using DML statements to insert data about three films. The tasks aimed to ensure data consistency and validation throughout the process. | SQL, Sakila Database, PostgreSQL, CTE, Films, Filming, Actors, Movie Genres, Vacuum, DML, Truncate, Delete, Insert. |
| [DDL](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/DDL) |  The first task required the creation of a recruitment database, which included additional data types, triggers, and functions. Additionally, an ERD was created to provide a visual representation of the database structure. The second task of the project involved the creation of a simple database for a healthcare system using SQL. Both databases were also populated with relevant data, with a particular emphasis on data validation and consistency. | ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, CTE, DDL, Create, Database Design, ERD Modelling, 3NF, Lucidchart, Data Consistency, Data Validation, Data Generation.|
| [Functions](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/Functions) | For this project, I worked with the Sakila database to analyze its functions and create new ones using PostgreSQL. The first task involved fixing errors and adding missing functionality to the existing functions. I then designed and implemented new functions, such as inserting new movies and returning information about customer rentals. | Sakila Database, PostgreSQL, CTE, Films, Filming, Actors, Customers, Functions. |
| [SQL for Analysis ](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/SQL%20for%20Analysis) | In this part I focused on the Sales Histore Database and its analysis. The primary goal was to create Star and Snowflake schemas for the database. I then identified three essential business metrics and wrote SQL queries to analyze the data, visualizing the output in Excel. Finally, I created a detailed report on the business metrics, which is attached in a word file. | SQL, Database Analysis, Sales History Database, ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, Data Modelling, Star, Snowflake, Business Metrics, ARPPU, Retention Rate, Conversion Rate. |
| [Window Functions](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/Window%20Functions%2C%20Frames) | The focus of this project was on analyzing the Sales History database using window functions and window frames. Window functions allow for partitioning data based on certain criteria and performing calculations on those partitions. By applying window functions to the project's business metrics, deeper insights could be gained into the trends and patterns within the data. | PostgreSQL, Window Functions, Window Frames, Partitions, Sales History Database, Data Analytics, Star schema, Ranking, Grouping, Crosstab. |
| [DCL](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/DCL) | In this part I worked with DCL statements, specifically the grant and revoke commands. The main tasks included implementing a role-based authentication model and configuring row-level security in the Sakila database to ensure that customers could only access their own data. Additionally, I learned about recommended authentication protocols and proxy authentication in PostgreSQL, as well as the differences between user identification and user authentication. | SQL, Database Analysis, Sakila Database, DCL, Grant, Revoke, Security, Database Roles, Role-based authentication, Row-level security. |
| [Home Heaven (Final) ](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/SQL_Final) | The project involved creating a database for a household store called Home Haven. This was achieved by starting from a business description and proceeding to data modelling and schema creation, followed by populating the database with appropriate data and setting up a manager role with the necessary privileges. | Data Modeling, Database Design, Data Validation, Database Management, SQL, PostgreSQL, Database Security, Data Migration. |
