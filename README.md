Repository contains portfolio of data analysis projects with SQL code, including DML, DDL, DQL, DCL and TCL statements, functions, OLTP and OLAP (star and snowflacke). Here, you'll find examples of entity-relationship diagrams and databases created using PostgreSQL language. From building databases to writing complex queries, you'll find a wealth of valuable information and examples to help you improve your skills. So, feel free to explore and experiment with the code in this repository, and don't hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback.

**Programming languages:** SQL (PostgreSQL, PLpgsql).

| [Create a DB](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/Create%20a%20DB) | In this project I've created an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a recruitment agency using the Lucidchart tool. The ERD includes an Infological model with entities, relationships, specified columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and data types. The business description that outlines how the recruitment agency works and identified the challenges they face in data storage. It also contains the DB modeling step-by-step and identifying and describing all of the DB objects.  | ERD, Lucidchart, Infological model, Recruitment Agency, Database Design, Data Management, Job Seekers, Job Postings, Resumes, Interviews. |
| [DQL](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/DQL) | The Sakila database is a sample database that is widely used in the industry for learning and testing purposes. It provides a rich and complex data model that captures information related to a fictional DVD rental company, including details on customers, films, rentals, and payments. The SQL queries were carefully designed to extract meaningful and relevant information, and the results were analyzed and interpreted to draw conclusions and develop recommendations. | SQL, Database Analysis, Sakila Database, ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, CTE, Films, Filming, Actors, Movie Genres. |
| [DML](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/blob/main/DML/README.md) | This part involved two main objectives: firstly, to explore the differences between delete and truncate statements, as well as the vacuum command, and secondly, to work with the Sakila database using DML statements to insert data about three films. The tasks aimed to ensure data consistency and validation throughout the process. | SQL, Database Analysis, Sakila Database, ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, CTE, Films, Filming, Actors, Movie Genres, Vacuum, DML, Truncate, Delete, Insert. |
| [DDL](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/DDL) |  The first task required the creation of a recruitment database, which included additional data types, triggers, and functions. Additionally, an ERD was created to provide a visual representation of the database structure. The second task of the project involved the creation of a simple database for a healthcare system using SQL. Both databases were also populated with relevant data, with a particular emphasis on data validation and consistency. | SQL, Database Analysis, ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, CTE, DDL, Create, Database Design, ERD Modelling, 3NF, Lucidchart, Data Consistency, Data Validation, Data Generation.|
| [Functions](https://github.com/yyeusiyevich/sql_for_analysis/tree/main/Functions) | For this project, I worked with the Sakila database to analyze its functions and create new ones using PostgreSQL. The first task involved fixing errors and adding missing functionality to the existing functions. I then designed and implemented new functions, such as inserting new movies and returning information about customer rentals. | SQL, Database Analysis, Sakila Database, ERD, Data Analysis, Data Insights, PostgreSQL, CTE, Films, Filming, Actors, Movie Genres, Functions. |
